# Introduction

Welcome to the nPOD Data Portal! This site functions as a hub for accessing the latest information on cases collected by the biorepository, sample inventory currently available for study, and datasets provided by nPOD investigators and collaborators.

The nPOD DataShare legacy site will be available for sample request placement and limited data access. The most accurate and up-to-date data will be accessible through the nPOD Data Portal; please view and download data from the new site as DataShare is in the process of being archived. We ask for your patience during this transition.
