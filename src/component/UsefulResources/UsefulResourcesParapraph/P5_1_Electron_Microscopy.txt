## Electron Microscopy

[Electron microscopy](https://assets.thermofisher.com/TFS-Assets/MSD/Handbooks/Exploring-uncharted-realms-with-electron-microscopy.pdf#gsc.tab=0) was originally developed as a research tool to observe inorganic materials at approximately 1,000-fold greater resolution than could be seen with a light microscope, based on the use of electrons as opposed to light waves. The brilliant work of pioneering cell biologists led to the discovery of a method for looking at biological tissues with these high-powered electron microscopes. There has been a remarkable increase in the use of electron microscopy as a research tool in biomedical sciences over the past few decades. However, the opportunity to look at the human pancreas at this detailed level was limited.

nPOD partnered with [Dr. Ben Giepmans](https://www.delmic.com/en/learn/customer-stories/dr-ben-giepmans-umcg), Associate Professor at the University of Groningen, to build a publicly shared database of electron microscopy images generated on pancreatic tissue samples from nPOD. To quote Ben, “the goal here is to better visualize how molecules, organelles and cells act in concert to organize life, and how this may be affected in diseases, with special interest in type 1 diabetes”. You can explore beautiful electron microscopy images of the pancreas for select nPOD cases under the “Explore Cases” tab. Can you recognize beta cells, identify cellular structures, or remember what insulin and glucagon granules look like at the ultrastructural level? To refresh your memory, we highly recommend utilizing this wonderfully [interactive workshop](https://edubox.nl/Instructie2016Html5.aspx#section=leereenheid&itemnr=3&itemid=&leereenheidid=902) that Ben put together for you. Armed with this knowledge, electron microscopy images may suddenly have a new meaning.

It is worth mentioning that raw files of electron microcopy images for the nPOD cohort will soon be available for download under the “Explore Datasets” tab in this portal.
