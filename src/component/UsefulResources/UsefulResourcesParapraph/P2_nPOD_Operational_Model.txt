# nPOD Operational Model

Since its establishment in 2007, [the Network for Pancreatic Organ donors with Diabetes (nPOD)](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/) has become the worldâ€™s largest biobank of human pancreas and other type 1 diabetes (T1D) related tissues. nPOD partners with all 58 organ procurement organizations (OPOs) across the United States (U.S.) to obtain high-quality tissues from persons with and at-risk for T1D. With this, nPOD has established a nationwide screening program wherein OPO-affiliated screening labs perform serological tests for islet autoantibodies (AAb) to identify rare non-diabetic AAb positive persons who carry high risk for T1D as well as new-onset T1D cases presenting with diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). This represents an invaluable resource for studying the immunological and metabolic events in the pancreas and its draining lymph nodes leading up to and exactly at the time of symptomatic onset. The nPOD Coordinating Center operates 24/7/365 days per year. Applications are reviewed by the Tissue Prioritization Committee (TPC), and samples are provided free of charge to approved investigators around the world to support research falling into one of seven categories (beta cell physiology and disfunction; beta bell development, differentiation and regeneration; immunology, novel biomarkers; novel technologies; pathology; type 1diabetes etiology and environment).
