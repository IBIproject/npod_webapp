## Sample Inventory

Access to the complete sample inventory is reserved for approved nPOD investigators, collaborators and their lab members. Our sample repository and database house more than 560 cases procured from organ donors whose families generously gave consent for research.

The sample inventory button will redirect you to the [nPOD DataShare site](https://npoddatashare.coh.org/labkey/login/home/login.view). This legacy site will be available for sample request placement and limited data access. The most up-to-date data will be accessible through the Explore Cases page. For any questions regarding order placement, please contact Dr. Irina Kusmartseva at <npod@pathology.ufl.edu>.
