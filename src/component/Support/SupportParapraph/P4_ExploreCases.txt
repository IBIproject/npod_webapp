## Explore Cases

Currently, only approved nPOD investigators, collaborators and their lab members are able to view clinical and family history data for nPOD cases. Our sample repository and database houses more than 560 cases procured from organ donors whose families generously gave consent for research. Information about sample collection and how to join nPOD can be found here: [nPOD for Investigators](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/)

To view and download case details including demographics, lab results, HLA, clinical history, tissue quality, histopathology images, functional and immunophenotyping data click on “Explore cases.”

Use the search filters on the left side to refine a list of donors that match your desired criteria. For information on a specific case, click the case ID toggle switch and select the case ID of interest. For help using search filters, mouse over the question icon next to each filter option. After selection, only cases fitting those criteria will be displayed.

A dropdown menu in the upper right corner allows you to download different data sets (All, Functional Assay, High Resolution HLA, etc).

The histopathology tab contains links to two partner sites for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy images.

If the image link is greyed out for either site, this indicates that there are no images online for that case.

No registration is required to view electron microscopy images at nanotomy.org (Courtesy of Dr. Giepmans). Once you click on the link, you will be taken directly to the EM image for the case.
