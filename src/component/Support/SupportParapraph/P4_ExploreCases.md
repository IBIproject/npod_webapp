## Explore Cases

Currently, only approved nPOD investigators, collaborators and their lab members are able to view clinical and family history data for nPOD cases. Our sample repository and database house more than 560 cases procured from organ donors whose families generously gave consent for research. Information about sample collection and how to join nPOD can be found here: [nPOD for Investigators](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/)

While no registration is required to view electron microscopy images, there is a separate login required for nPOD Online Pathology access via Aperio eSlide Manager. If you already have an account, use your existing login credentials.

If you do not have an account, use the [Online Pathology Password Request Form](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/password-request-form/) to receive full access to our slide images. See [nPOD Online Pathology Information](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/online-pathology-information/) for details about our image collection. If you are not yet an approved investigator but wish to view the image collection, please use the password request form above.
