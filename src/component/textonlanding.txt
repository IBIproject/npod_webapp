# How To

Welcome to the nPOD Data Portal! This site functions as a hub for accessing the latest information on cases collected by the biorepository, sample inventory currently available for study, and datasets provided by nPOD investigators and collaborators.

## Sign In

User access is provided by nPOD upon request. Please email [npod@pathology.ufl.edu](mailto:npod@pathology.ufl.edu) to request the invitation code. In your email subject line, enter ‘Data Portal Invitation Code Request’ and our admin team will respond within 1 business day.

Please choose a username, enter your university or institution email address, and create a unique password. Input the invitation code from nPOD, add press ‘EMAIL CONFIRMATION CODE’ to proceed. A code will be sent to your provided email address. When you sign in again, use this confirmation code to finish your account creation.

After you sign in, click your username to log out or change your password. If you encounter any issues, please email [npod@pathology.ufl.edu](mailto:npod@pathology.ufl.edu)

## Explore Cases

Currently, only approved nPOD investigators, collaborators and their lab members are able to view clinical and family history data for nPOD cases. Our sample repository and database house more than 560 cases procured from organ donors whose families generously gave consent for research. Information about sample collection and how to join nPOD can be found here: [nPOD for Investigators](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/)

To view donor details including demographics, lab results, HLA, clinical history, tissue quality, and histopathology images, either select a case from the list displayed by nPOD donor ID, or use the search filter on the left side.

For help using search filters, mouse over the question icon next to each filter option. After selection, only cases fitting those criteria will be displayed. Use the ‘DOWNLOAD ALL’ button to download an Excel file with case information from the filtered list.

To view a particular case, click the donor ID number to open the case display. Click on the headers to scroll between data subsets. Use the ‘DOWNLOAD ALL’ button to download information for this individual case.

The HISTOPATHOLOGY tab contains links to two partner sites for immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy images. If the link is not available, this indicates that no images are online for the case. While no registration is required to view electron microscopy images, there is a separate login required for nPOD Online Pathology access through Aperio eSlide Manager. If you already have an account, please use your existing login credentials. If you do not have an account, please use the [Online Pathology Password Request Form](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/password-request-form/) to receive full access to our slide images. See [nPOD Online Pathology Information](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/online-pathology-information/) for details about our image collection. If you are not yet an approved investigator but wish to view the image collection, please use the password request form above.

## Sample Inventory

Access to the complete sample inventory is reserved for approved nPOD investigators, collaborators and their lab members. Our sample repository and database house more than 560 cases procured from organ donors whose families generously gave consent for research.

The sample inventory button will redirect you to the nPOD DataShare site. This legacy site will be available for sample request placement and limited data access until the sample ordering has been migrated to the new Data Portal. The most up-to-date data will be accessible through the Explore Cases page; please use the new site as DataShare is in the process of being archived. We ask for your patience during this transition. For any questions regarding order placement, please contact Dr. Irina Kusmartseva at [npod@pathology.ufl.edu](mailto:npod@pathology.ufl.edu).

A separate login is currently required for the DataShare site. If you are already a registered user, your login email and password have not changed. If you are a new user, please email [npod@pathology.ufl.edu](mailto:npod@pathology.ufl.edu) to request login credentials. See our [Sample Request Guidelines](https://www.jdrfnpod.org/for-investigators/request-npod-samples/) for details as well as a user guide for DataShare.

## Explore Datasets and Submit Datasets

The Explore and Submit Datasets features are currently in development. nPOD was created and is sustained through collaboration and a culture of sharing. All nPOD investigators become members of the nPOD Consortium and agree to the Data Sharing policy. As these features become available, investigators will be contacted to submit previously published datasets and are highly encouraged to release sequencing, genomic, proteomic, flow cytometry, and image analysis data for use by the Consortium.

For all questions regarding the Data Portal and sample requests, please reach out to us at [npod@pathology.ufl.edu](mailto:npod@pathology.ufl.edu).
